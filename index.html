Research Question:

&gt; What role does religiosity play in support for religious governance?

## Theoretical Framework


---

## Theory

+ A commonly proposed explanation for the support for Political Islam is that devout Muslims simply
support religious governance out of their religious convictions

--

+ This proposed relationship falls in danger to become tautological and essentialist in nature, leading to explanations that Muslims support Political Islam *because they are Muslims*

--

Tessler describes the problematic nature of such arguments as this 

&gt; "mistakenly assume[s] that there are clear and uncontested definitions of what constitute [...] 'Muslim' orientations" and "[...] ignores the significant differences that exist between Arab and Muslim countries, as well as the equally important individual-level variation that exists within countries [...] associated with age, education, class, gender, ethnicity, and residence." 

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Tessler, 2015, pp. 54-55&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

---

## Hypotheses

**Secularization Theory** *(Norris &amp; Inglehart, 2011)*

&gt; *H1a:* Increasing individual material resources marginalizes support for religious governance.

&gt; *H1b:* Increasing intellectual resources marginalize support for religious governance.

--

**Parochialism**

&gt; *H2:* Parochial viewpoints increase support for religious governance.

--

**Patriarchal Values**

&gt; *H3:* Patriarchal Values increase the support for religious governance.

---


## Hypotheses

**The Role of Religiosity**

&gt; *H4a:* Religiosity increases the support for religious governance.


&gt; *H4b:* Liberal interpretations of Islam decrease the support for religious governance.

--

*Interactions*

&gt; *H4c:* If an individual endorses patriarchal values, religiosity has a stronger effect on
the support for religious governance than for individuals who endorse more gender egalitarian
views.

--

&gt; *H4d:* If an individual endorses liberal interpretations of Islam, religiosity has a
diminished or even reversed effect on the support for religious governance.

## Data &amp; Methodology


---

## Data &amp; Methodology


+ Merging of the following datasets: 
  + Arabbarometer Survey Round 3 (data from 2014-2015)  
  + Arabbarometer Survey Round 4 (data from 2015-2016)  
  
+ In total 13.495 individual cases in 12 Arab countries
  + weighted with provided weight

### Dependent Variable - *Support for Islamism* 

.ninety[

*To what extent [do] you think these systems would be appropriate for your country?*

+ Religious leaders (imams, preachers, priests) should have influence over government decisions

+ Your country is better off if religious people hold public positions in the state 

+ A system governed by Islamic law without elections or political parties

+ A parliamentary system (based on Islamic law) in which only Islamist parties compete in parliamentary elections

#### Independent Variables

*Secularization Theory*

+ Employment (0/1)
+ Financial Security
+ Education 
    
--
    
*Parochialism*

+ Do you think that the increase in global connectivity is a good or a bad thing for the society?
      
--
      
*Religiosity*

+ Personal Piety
 + Do you pray daily?
 + Do you listen to or read the Quran? 
 
--
 
*Patriarchal Values*
 
+ A married woman can work outside the home. 
+ In general, men are better at political leadership than women. 
+ University education for males is more important than university education for females.
 
---

#### Independent Variables

*Liberal Islam*

&gt; The opinions of Islamic jurists and religious scholars differ and I want to ask to what extent you
agree or disagree with some of these issues?

+ Democracy is a system that contradicts the teachings of Islam.
+ Gender-mixed education should be allowed in universities. 
+ Women should wear modest clothes without needing to wear hijab. 

--

*Control Variables*

+ Sex (Male/Female)
+ Age
+ Year 2012 (0/1)
+ Year 2013 (0/1)
+ Year 2014 (0/1)

## Analysis &amp; Results

---

## Analysis

+ Individuals are nested into countries, so that application of *multilevel models* is suitable

+ ICC: 14.66% of the variance of Islamism is bound on the country-level

+ Sequential approach 
    + *Models 1-5* continually add one variable to the model
    + *Model 6* shows the main model with all variables
    + *Model 7-8* show estimated interaction effects
    
+ No severe violations of residual assumptions can be found

## Conclusions &amp; Future Research

---

## Conclusions &amp; Future Research

+ Financial Security shows no significant effect, whereas increased education and unemployment do

--

+ Parochialism and Patriarchal values both seem to increase the support for religious governance

--

+ Religion does matter and it matters *a lot*
    + However: Liberal interpretations of Islam decrease the support for religious governance
    + The moderating effects are *strongest* for the most religious individuals

--
    
+ Further studies in the field should account for the very diverse interpretations and multidimensionality of religion and religiosity in that context. 

--

+ Much variation has been found between countries
    + Future research should consider case-studies of individual countries
