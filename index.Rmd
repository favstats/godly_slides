## Theoretical Framework


---

## Theory

**Secularization Theory**

> *H1a:* Increasing individual material resources marginalizes support for religious governance.

> *H1b:* Increasing intellectual resources marginalize support for religious governance.

--

**Parochialism**

> *H2:* Parochial viewpoints increase support for religious governance.

--

**Patriarchal Values**

> *H3:* Patriarchal Values increase the support for religious governance.

---


## Theory

**The Role of Religiosity**

> *H4a:* Religiosity increases the support for religious governance.


> *H4b:* Liberal interpretations of Islam decrease the support for religious governance.

--

*Interactions*

> *H4c:* If an individual endorses patriarchal values, religiosity has a stronger eﬀect on
the support for religious governance than for individuals who endorse more gender egalitarian
views.

--

> *H4d:* If an individual endorses liberal interpretations of Islam, religiosity has a
diminished or even reversed eﬀect on the support for religious governance.

## Data & Methodology

#### Data & Methodology


+ Merging of the following datasets: 
  + Arabbarometer Survey, Round 3 and Round 4 (data from 2011-2015)  

+ In total 316,938 individual cases in 119 Countries
  + weighted to same sample size (=1000)

## Analysis & Results

## Analysis

+ Multilevel Models
    + In total 91 seperate models
    + DVs: Regime Support (No, Low, High Bias)
    + Main IVs: All six Deliberation indicators

## Conclusions & Future Research

---

## Conclusions & Future Research

* No simple answer to research question
 + deliberation seems to have a positive effect on regime support in democracies
 + less robust and ambiguous results for non-democracies and complete sample
    
    
* Presumably biased regime support
 + should be taken into account 
 + possible remedies? (e.g. weighting procedures, survey design)

* Validity of the DCI
    + more sensitive approaches to measure deliberation on the country level are neccessary
    + nevertheless interesting differences regarding the subsamples
